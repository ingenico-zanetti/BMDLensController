# BMDLensControler
FW for Bluepill on a carrier-board replacing FUJINON -BMD old analog servo control board.
Select Board: "Generic STM32F1 series" ;
Select Board part number: "Bluepill F103CB (or C8 with 128l)" ; 
Build with USB support set to "CDC (generic 'Serial' supersede U(S)ART)" ; 
This turns the Bluepill into a CDC-ACM, AT-command driven Fujinon -BMD lens controller
This requires a carrier board to interface with the lens potentiometer and motor: https://oshwlab.com/azanetti/aw-lz14md55
